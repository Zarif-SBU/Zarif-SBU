# ðŸ‘‹ Hi there, I'm Zarif
I recently graudated from Stony Brook University where I majored in both Computer Science and Applied Mathematics. I am an aspiring data scientist eager to leverage my data wrangling and analytical skills but I am also very much interested in SWE roles.

## ðŸ”§ Tech Stack:
Languages: Python, MATLAB, TypeScript, Java, R, SQL, C, HTML, CSS

Libraries and Frameworks: 
Python: Numpy, Scipy, Pandas, GeoPandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn, Pytorch

- Fake Stack Overflow: A Q&A site similar to Stack Overflow (my first web-development project)

## ðŸŽ“ Research:
I am currently working as a Part-time Research Assistant under the Mentorship of Professor Robert Kelly at Stony Brook University. As part of his research team, [PoliTech](https://www.stonybrook.edu/commcms/vertically-integrated-projects/teams/_team_page/team_page.php?team=PoliTech), I am designing and building the UI/UX of our web-based analytics tool used to analyze gerrymendaring of US State District Plans and promote fairer District boundaries that that give everyone equal voice and representation. 
In addition, I've written internal documentation to specify the data requirments of our research and work alongside other subgroups to ensure our data goals are being met.

## ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on 
- In addition to my Research, I continue to work on Kura Customs to maintain the site and design new products.
- In my journey as an aspring data scientist, I am teaching myself Pytorch and Tensorflow to add to my knowledge of Neural Networks and Machine Learning.

## ðŸ“« How to reach me:
You can reach me through my email zarifahnaf1@gmail.com or message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ahmedzarif/) !.

## âš¡ Fun fact:
I love going to the gym! You can find my strength training program on [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1HTtwe-_TaECKVSRgNuGg4TIgcE6C0xXnGQ4i_nehSic/edit?usp=sharing)! Realistically tho I am not following it 5 times a week as I used to.
I also want to get into Calisthenics and Started basic calisthenics trianing.
